#### Hey there, I'm Gabriel.

Iâ€™ve been passionate about tech and electronics since I was a kid. However, I started my professional journey in investment banking and private equity focused on tech and software. 

My brain was always wired for coding and building. I started out creating tools with a scientific calculator at school and later on moved on to Excel and VBA. I then taught myself Python, Ruby/Rails and JavaScript.

With the rise of AI, I found a new level of leverage: rational thinking + AI + code = ðŸš€.

I [automate](https://www.gabrielbacha.com/optimization/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github_profile) anything I can at home and on my Mac. I love tinkering with side projects. While most of my repositories are private, I occasionally share tools and ideas that might be useful to others.
